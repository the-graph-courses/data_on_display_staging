Welcome to your first data-based quiz on data visualization! For data-based quizzes, you will need to import data into R as you follow the questions.

## How to use `ggplot_digest()`

This function is necessary to process data visualization quizzes. Copy and run this code to add the function to your R environment.

```{r}

# Import function
# CAN CHANGE THIS TO GIST LINK?
ggplot_digest <- function(myplot) {
  # Create temp file name, save plot, digest file, and remove temp file
  plotfile <- tempfile(pattern = "ggplot_", fileext = ".png")
  suppressMessages(ggplot2::ggsave(filename = plotfile, plot = myplot, type = "cairo"))
  plot_crypt <- digest::digest(file = plotfile)
  file.remove(plotfile)
  return(plot_crypt)
}
```

Some questions require you to create a plot and submit an encryption (?). In this example we will walk you through how to do this using the `iris` dataset that is built into R.

First write your `ggplot` code and save it as an R object.

```{r}

# Create plot
ggplot(data = iris,
       mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Width,
                     y = Sepal.Length,
                     color = Species)) +
  geom_point()

# Save plot as object
myplot <- 
  ggplot(data = iris,
       mapping = aes(x = Species,
                     y = Sepal.Length,
                     fill = Species)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Once you are sure you have your final answer, put your object through the **`ggplot_digest()`** function. This will produce a unique character string.

```{r}

# Run function on plot object
ggplot_digest(myplot)
```

The string will be 32 characters long and contain letters and numbers.

```{recho = false}
hash_iris <- ggplot_digest(myplot)
```

You can then copy and paste this alphanumeric string into the answer boxes in this quiz. Try entering the string from the last plot.

Enter the alphanumeric serial number for your plot: {`r hash_iris`}

We will use this to check your answer, so please ensure you have copied it correctly.


# HIV dataset

Here, you will analyze parts of a dataset documenting global HIV prevalence from 1990 to 2011.

```{r echo = F, results = "asis"}
upload_and_link(hiv_prevalence, filename = "hiv_prevalence", format =  "csv")
```

Note that each time you retry a quiz, the dataset is slightly modified so that you get a different set of countries.

Here are the top 6 rows of **`hiv_prevalence`** after import:

```{r}
head(hiv_prevalence)

```
There are four variables:
1.  **`country`** : Country name
2.  **`year`** : Calendar year
3.  **`total_cases`**: Number of people estimated to be infected by HIV.
4.  **`population`**:


Take a closer look at the composition of each variable:
```{r}
summary(hiv_prevalence)
```
This version of the dataset contains records of HIV case count and population for **3 countries**. over **15 years** (1995 to 2009).


In this quiz you will create plots to look at how the number of HIV cases or population changes over time for the 3 countries.

**Complete the code below to create a simple scatter plot of HIV incidence over time using `ggplot()`.**

The resulting plot should look like this:

```{r echo = F}

ggplot(hiv_prevalence, aes(year, total_cases)) +
  geom_point()
```

Hint: note which variables are mapped to which axis, and refer to the `ggplot()` syntax template to structure your code.

![](images/gg_min_build3.png){width="600"}

```{r eval = F}

ggplot(data = hiv_prevalence, 
       mapping = aes(x = {year},
                       y = {total_cases})) +
  geom_point()
```

This scatter plot doesn't allow us to distinguish between the 3 countries in your dataset.

**Add an aesthetic argument that will color each point according to country.**

```{r include=F}

ggplot(hiv_prevalence, aes(year, total_cases, color = country)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r eval = F}

ggplot(data = {hiv_prevalence}, 
       {mapping} = aes(x = year,
                       y = total_cases,
                       {[color=country][col=country]|2})) +
  geom_point()
```

Answer `true` or `false`: The aesthetic argument we just added is a fixed aesthetic: {[false][f]}


**Use the `high_prevalence`** **dataset in R to create a stacked bar plot of total cases per year.**

The plot should look like this

```{r echo = F}
filled_bar <- ggplot(high_hiv_prev, aes(year, total_cases,
                          fill = country)) +
  geom_col()

filled_bar

hash_filled_bar <- ggplot_digest(filled_bar)
```

Hint: you will need to use the `geom_col()` function.

Process your plot with `ggplot_digest()` and copy the resulting alphanumeric string. 

Enter the alphanumeric serial number for your plot: {`r hash_filled_bar`}


**Complete the below code to create a colored line graph** **showing a separate line for each country.**

```{r eval = F}

ggplot(data = hiv_prevalence, 
             mapping = aes(x = year, 
                           y = total_cases,
                           color = country)) + 
      geom_line()
```

```{r eval = F}

ggplot(data = hiv_prevalence, 
             mapping = aes(x = year, 
                           y = total_cases,
                           {[color][col]} = country)) {+} 
      {geom_line()}
```

**Name an aesthetic argument you can use to change the thickness of lines in a line graph**. {[size][lwd][linewidth]}

I wrote the following code to change the width of all lines in this plot to 1 mm:

```{r fig.width=5}

ggplot(data = hiv_prevalence, 
             mapping = aes(x = year, 
                           y = population,
                           color = country,
                           size = 1)) + 
      geom_line()
```

Uh oh! That doesn't look right. Can you find and fix the mistake in my code?

Hint: Aesthetic arguments like `x`, `y`, `color`, `fill`, and `size` can either be a mapping of a variable or a fixed value. This depends on whether they are written inside `mapping = aes()` or inside a `geom_*()` function.

Use the `hiv_prevalence` dataframe in R to create the line graph of population vs. year where the width of all lines is 1 mm. The plot should look like this:

```{r echo = F}
ggplot(hiv_prevalence, 
                     aes(year, population,
                         color = country)) +
  geom_line(size = 1)
```

```{r echo = F}
# Generate correct hash
line_size <- ggplot(hiv_prevalence, 
                     aes(year, population,
                         color = country)) +
  geom_line(size = 1)

hash_line_size <- ggplot_digest(line_size)
```

Enter the alphanumeric serial number for your plot: {`r hash_line_size`}


**Identify which plot is using the `color` aesthetic for the `country` variable.**

```{r echo=FALSE}
p_load(patchwork)
theme_set(theme_grey())

plot1 <- ggplot(hiv_prevalence, aes(country, total_cases,
                                    fill = country)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Plot A")

plot2 <- ggplot(hiv_prevalence, aes(country, total_cases,
                                    color = country)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Plot B")

plot1 + plot2
```

Answer `A` or `B`: Plot {B}

Let's say we want to create a bar plot where the outline color and fill color are different. For example, the bars in this bar plot of cases per year have colorful segments and a `black` outline:

```{r echo=F}
# Fixed color and mapped fill
ggplot(hiv_prevalence, 
       aes(year, total_cases, fill = country)) +
  geom_col(color = "black")
```

**Complete the code below to generate this plot.**

```{r eval = F}
ggplot(data = hiv_prevalence, 
       mapping = aes(x = year,
                     y = total_cases,
                     {fill} = {country})) +
  geom_point({color} = {"black"|"#000000"})
```

**Complete the code below to create Plot B**

```{r echo=F}
plot3 <- ggplot(hiv_prevalence, 
       aes(year, population, color = country)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Plot A")

plot4 <- ggplot(hiv_prevalence, 
       aes(year, population)) + 
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  ggtitle("Plot B")

plot3 + plot4
```

Note: The R color used to color points in Plot B is `"red"` .

```{r eval = F}
ggplot(data = hiv_prevalence, 
             mapping = aes(x = year, 
                           {[y = total_cases][total_cases]|2})) +} 
      {geom_line({[color = "red"][color = "	#FF0000"]|2})}
```
