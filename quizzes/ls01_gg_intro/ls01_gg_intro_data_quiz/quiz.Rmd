Welcome to your first data-based quiz on data visualization! For data-based quizzes, you will need to import data into R as you follow the questions. Here, you will analyze HIV cases from around the world.

# HIV dataset

```{r echo = F, results = "asis"}
upload_and_link(hiv_prev_sample, filename = "hiv_prevalence", format =  "csv")
```

Note that each time you retry a quiz, the dataset is slightly modified so that you get a different set of countries. If you are retaking this quiz, please ensure that download the new data again.

Let's look at the top 6 rows of **`hiv_prevalence`** after import:

```{r}
head(hiv_prevalence)
```

There are four variables:

1\. **`country`** : Country name

2\. **`year`** : Calendar year

3\. **`total_cases`**: Number of people estimated to be infected by HIV.

4\. **`population`**: Total population

Take a closer look at the composition of each variable:

```{r}
summary(hiv_prevalence)
```

The countries in your dataset are: `r unique(hiv_prevalence$country)`.

In this quiz you will create plots to look at how the number of total HIV cases in these countries changes over this time period.

## Basic scatter plot

**Complete the code below to create a simple scatter plot of HIV cases over time using `ggplot()`.**

```{r eval = F}

ggplot(data = {hiv_prevalence}, 
       mapping = aes(x = {year},
                     y = {total_cases})) +
  {geom_point()}
```

When you run the completed code in R, the resulting plot should look like this:

```{r echo = F}

ggplot(hiv_prevalence, aes(year, total_cases)) +
  geom_point()
```

**Hint**: Refer to the `ggplot()` code template.

## Scatterplot with color

The points in this scatter plot are all the same, so it doesn't allow us to visually see which country each data point is from.

We can modify the code from the basic scatter plot to create a plot like this:

```{r echo=F}

ggplot(hiv_prevalence, aes(year, total_cases, color = country)) +
  geom_point()
```

**Add an aesthetic argument that will color each point according to country.**

```{r eval = F}

ggplot(data = hiv_prevalence, 
       {mapping} = aes(x = year,
                       y = total_cases,
                       {[color=country][colour=country][col=country]|2})) +
  {geom_point()}
```

## Fixed vs. mapped aesthetics

The aesthetic argument you added to color the points by `country` is a **fixed aesthetic**, not an **mapping**: {[false][f]} 
(Enter "true" or "false")


## Line graph with color

**Complete the below code to create a line graph with a different color for each country.**

```{r eval = F}

ggplot({data} = hiv_prevalence, 
             mapping = {aes}(x = year, 
                           y = total_cases,
                           {[color][col][colour]} = country)) {+} 
      {geom_line()}
```


```{r echo = F}

# correct
correct_plot <- ggplot(hiv_prev_sample, 
  aes(year, total_cases, color = country)) + 
  geom_line() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# wrong 1
country_sample2 <- high_hiv_prev_pop$country %>% 
  unique() %>% sample(3)

hiv_prev_sample2 <- high_hiv_prev_pop %>% 
  filter(country %in% country_sample2) %>% 
  mutate(country = as.factor(country))


wrong_plot1 <- ggplot(hiv_prev_sample2, 
  aes(year, total_cases, 
    color = country)) + 
  geom_line() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# wrong 2
country_sample3 <- high_hiv_prev_pop$country %>% 
  unique() %>% sample(3)

hiv_prev_sample3 <- high_hiv_prev_pop %>% 
  filter(country %in% country_sample3) %>% 
  mutate(country = as.factor(country))


wrong_plot2 <- ggplot(hiv_prev_sample3, 
  aes(year, total_cases, 
    color = country)) + 
  geom_line() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# wrong 2
country_sample3 <- high_hiv_prev_pop$country %>% 
  unique() %>% sample(3)

hiv_prev_sample3 <- high_hiv_prev_pop %>% 
  filter(country %in% country_sample3) %>% 
  mutate(country = as.factor(country))


wrong_plot2 <- ggplot(hiv_prev_sample3, 
  aes(year, total_cases, 
    color = country)) + 
  geom_line() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# wrong 3
country_sample4 <- high_hiv_prev_pop$country %>% 
  unique() %>% sample(3)

hiv_prev_sample4 <- high_hiv_prev_pop %>% 
  filter(country %in% country_sample4) %>% 
  mutate(country = as.factor(country))


wrong_plot3 <- ggplot(hiv_prev_sample4, 
  aes(year, total_cases, 
    color = country)) + 
  geom_line() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# wrong 4
country_sample5 <- high_hiv_prev_pop$country %>% 
  unique() %>% sample(3)

hiv_prev_sample5 <- high_hiv_prev_pop %>% 
  filter(country %in% country_sample5) %>% 
  mutate(country = as.factor(country))


wrong_plot4 <- ggplot(hiv_prev_sample5, 
  aes(year, total_cases, 
    color = country)) + 
  geom_line() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")


plotlist <- sample(list(correct_plot = correct_plot, wrong_plot1 = wrong_plot1, wrong_plot2 = wrong_plot2, 
  wrong_plot3 = wrong_plot3, wrong_plot4 = wrong_plot4))

correct_plot_letter <- which(names(plotlist) == "correct_plot") %>% chartr(old = "1234", new = "abcd")

option_grid <- cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist[[1]], plotlist[[2]], plotlist[[3]], plotlist[[4]], labels = "auto")
```

**Which of the plots below (from a to f) most closely resembles your output plot? Letter: {`r correct_plot_letter`}**

```{r echo = F}
option_grid
```




## Modify line width

**Name an aesthetic argument you can use to change the width of lines in a line graph**: {[size][lwd][linewidth]}

Let's say I want the lines in the plot to be a little thicker, like this:

```{r echo = F}
ggplot(hiv_prevalence, 
                     aes(year, total_cases,
                         color = country)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1)
```

So I tried to change the width of all lines in this plot to 1 mm with this code:

```{r fig.width=5}

ggplot(data = hiv_prevalence, 
             mapping = aes(x = year, 
                           y = total_cases,
                           color = country,
                           linewidth = 1)) + 
      geom_line()
```

Uh oh! The plot doesn't look right. Can you find the mistake in my code?

**Enter "true" or "false" for each statement:**

The geometry function used is correct. {[true][t]}  

The x & y axis mappings should be outside `aes()`. {[false][f]} 

The size or line width should be assigned in `geom_line()`. {[true][t]} 

The color should be assigned in `geom_line()`. {[false][f]} 

**Hint**: Aesthetic arguments like `x`, `y`, `color`, `fill`, and `size` can either be a mapping of a variable or a fixed value. This depends on whether they are written inside `mapping = aes()` or inside a `geom_()` function.


## Color vs. Fill

### Plot 1: Boxplot

Here are two plots showing the distribution of `total_cases` for each country.

```{r echo=FALSE}
p_load(patchwork)
theme_set(theme_grey())

plot1 <- ggplot(hiv_prevalence, aes(country, total_cases,
                                    fill = country)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Plot A")

plot2 <- ggplot(hiv_prevalence, aes(country, total_cases,
                                    color = country)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Plot B")

plot1 + plot2
```

**Identify which plot is using the `color` aesthetic for the `country` variable.**

Answer with `A` or `B`: Plot {B}

### Plot 2: Bar plot

Now let's create a stacked bar plot where the outline color and inside color are different. For example, the bars in this bar plot of cases per year have colorful segments and a black outline:

```{r echo=F}
# Fixed color and mapped fill
ggplot(hiv_prevalence, 
       aes(year, population, fill = country)) +
  geom_col(color = "black")
```

**Complete the code below to generate this plot.**

```{r eval = F}
ggplot(data = hiv_prevalence, 
       mapping = {aes}(x = year,
                     y = {population},
                     {fill} = {country})) +
  geom_col({[color][col][colour]} = {["black"]["#000000"]})
```
**Hint**: The R color used to color bar outlines in this plot is "black".

### Plot 3: 

Here are two plots showing the change in population over time for each country:

```{r echo=F}

plot3 <- ggplot(hiv_prevalence, 
       aes(year, population, color = country)) + 
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Plot A")

plot4 <- ggplot(hiv_prevalence, 
       aes(year, population)) + 
  geom_line(color = "seagreen") +
  ggtitle("Plot B")

plot3 + plot4
```

**Complete the code below to create Plot B**

```{r eval=F}
ggplot(data = hiv_prevalence, 
             mapping = aes(x = year, 
                           {[y = population][population]|2})) {+} 
      geom_line({[color = "seagreen"][colour = "seagreen"][col = "seagreen"]})
```

**Hint**: The R color used to color bar outlines in this plot is "seagreen".
