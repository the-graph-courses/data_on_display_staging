Welcome to your first data-based quiz on data visualization! For data-based quizzes, you will need to import data into R as you follow the questions.

```{r echo = F, results = "asis"}
upload_and_link(hiv_prevalence, filename = "hiv_prevalence", format =  "csv")
```

Note that each time you retry a quiz, the dataset is slightly modified so that you get a different set of countries.

Some questions require you to create and submit a plots. You will need to be able run code in R in order to complete this quiz.

In order to submit as plots as answers in this quiz, you will need a function called **`get_plot_key()`**. This function will "digest" your plot and give it a unique alphanumeric **key**, so you don't need to save and submit every plot for grading.

We will now walk you through a reproducible example of how to use `get_plot_key()` to create an answer for this quiz.

First, run this code to add `get_plot_key()` as a function in your R environment.

```{r}

# Import function

# devtools::source_gist("INSERT LINK")
```

A quiz question might ask you to do the following:

**Use the `iris`** **dataset in R to create a scatter plot of `Sepal.Width` against `Sepal.Length`. Color the points by `Species`**.

First, write your solution to the quest using `ggplot()` in R.

```{r}
# Create plot to answer the question
ggplot(data = iris,
       mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Width,
                     y = Sepal.Length,
                     color = Species)) +
  geom_point()

```

Once you are sure you have your final answer, save your plot as an R object.

```{r}
# Store plot as an R object
plot_name <- 
  ggplot(data = iris,
       mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Width,
                     y = Sepal.Length,
                     color = Species)) +
  geom_point()
  
```

Next, put your plot object in the **`get_plot_key()`** function. This will produce the unique key.

```{r}
# Run function on plot object
get_plot_key(plot_name)
```

The unique alphanumeric key for this plot is 1c1df9d84a66e103b59e2b8e0ed1c386. Your key will look different, but it should also be 32 characters long and contain letters and numbers.

```{r echo = F}
hash_iris <- get_plot_key(plot_name)
```

Finally, you will need to submit your answer by copying the key string and pasting into the corresponding answer box in this quiz.

The answer box will look like this:

**Enter the unique key for your plot here**: {`r hash_iris`}

Try entering the key from the last plot.

We will use the keys to check your answers, so please ensure you have copied and pasted the whole key string correctly.

# HIV dataset

Here, you will analyze parts of a dataset documenting global HIV prevalence from 1990 to 2011.

Here are the top 6 rows of **`hiv_prevalence`** after import:

```{r}
head(hiv_prevalence)

```

There are four variables: 1. **`country`** : Country name 2. **`year`** : Calendar year 3. **`total_cases`**: Number of people estimated to be infected by HIV. 4. **`population`**: Total population

Take a closer look at the composition of each variable:

```{r}
summary(hiv_prevalence)
```

This version of the dataset contains records of HIV case count and population for **3 countries** over **15 years** (1995 to 2009).

In this quiz you will create plots to look at how the number of total HIV cases in these countries changes over this time period.

**Complete the code below to create a simple scatter plot of HIV incidence over time using `ggplot()`.**

The resulting plot should look like this:

```{r echo = F}

ggplot(hiv_prevalence, aes(year, total_cases)) +
  geom_point()
```

Hint: note which variables are mapped to which axis, and refer to the `ggplot()` syntax template to structure your code.

```{r echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics(here("lessons/images/gg_min_build3.png"))
```

```{r eval = F}

ggplot(data = hiv_prevalence, 
       mapping = aes(x = {year},
                       y = {total_cases})) +
  geom_point()
```

This scatter plot doesn't allow us to distinguish between the 3 countries in the dataset.

**Add an aesthetic argument that will color each point according to country.**

```{r include=F}

ggplot(hiv_prevalence, aes(year, total_cases, color = country)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r eval = F}

ggplot(data = {hiv_prevalence}, 
       {mapping} = aes(x = year,
                       y = total_cases,
                       {[color=country][colour=country][col=country]|2})) +
  geom_point()
```

The aesthetic argument we just added is a fixed aesthetic: {[false][f]} (**`true`** or **`false`**)

**Use the `high_prevalence`** **dataset in R to create a stacked bar plot of total cases per year.**

Hint: you will need to use the **`geom_col()`** function.

The plot should look like this

```{r echo = F}
filled_bar <- ggplot(high_hiv_prev, aes(year, total_cases,
                          fill = country)) +
  geom_col()

filled_bar

hash_filled_bar <- get_plot_key(filled_bar)
```

Process your plot with `get_plot_key()` and copy the resulting alphanumeric string.

**Enter the unique key for your plot here**: {`r hash_filled_bar` \|5}

**Complete the below code to create a colored line graph** **showing a separate line for each country.**

```{r include = F}

ggplot(data = hiv_prevalence, 
             mapping = aes(x = year, 
                           y = total_cases,
                           color = country)) + 
      geom_line()
```

```{r eval = F}

ggplot(data = hiv_prevalence, 
             mapping = aes(x = year, 
                           y = total_cases,
                           {[color][col][colour]} = country)) {+} 
      {geom_line()}
```

The plot that should be created from the code above will look like this:

```{r echo = F}
ggplot(hiv_prevalence, 
                     aes(year, total_cases,
                         color = country)) +
  geom_line()
```

Let's say I want the lines in the plot to be a little thicker.

**Name an aesthetic argument you can use to change the width of lines in a line graph**. {[size][lwd][linewidth]}

I wrote the following code to change the width of all lines in this plot to 1 mm:

```{r fig.width=5}

ggplot(data = hiv_prevalence, 
             mapping = aes(x = year, 
                           y = total_cases,
                           color = country,
                           size = 1)) + 
      geom_line()
```

Uh oh! That doesn't look right. Can you find and fix the mistake in my code?

Hint: Aesthetic arguments like `x`, `y`, `color`, `fill`, and `size` can either be a mapping of a variable or a fixed value. This depends on whether they are written inside `mapping = aes()` or inside a `geom_*()` function.

**Use the `hiv_prevalence` dataframe in R to create the line graph of population vs. year where the width of all lines is 1 mm.**

The plot should look like this:

```{r echo = F}
ggplot(hiv_prevalence, 
                     aes(year, total_cases,
                         color = country)) +
  geom_line(size = 1)
```

```{r echo = F}
# Generate correct hash
line_size <- ggplot(hiv_prevalence, 
                     aes(year, total_cases,
                         color = country)) +
  geom_line(size = 1)

hash_line_size <- get_plot_key(line_size)
```

**Enter the unique key for your plot here**: {`r hash_line_size` \|5}

Here are two plots showing the distribution of `total_cases` for each country.

```{r echo=FALSE}
p_load(patchwork)
theme_set(theme_grey())

plot1 <- ggplot(hiv_prevalence, aes(country, total_cases,
                                    fill = country)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Plot A")

plot2 <- ggplot(hiv_prevalence, aes(country, total_cases,
                                    color = country)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Plot B")

plot1 + plot2
```

**Identify which plot is using the `color` aesthetic for the `country` variable.**

Answer with `A` or `B`: Plot {B}

Now let's create a bar plot where the outline color and fill color are different. For example, the bars in this bar plot of cases per year have colorful segments and a black outline:

```{r echo=F}
# Fixed color and mapped fill
ggplot(hiv_prevalence, 
       aes(year, total_cases, fill = country)) +
  geom_col(color = "black")
```

**Complete the code below to generate this plot.**

Hint: The R color used to color points in this plot is "`black`".

```{r eval = F}
ggplot(data = hiv_prevalence, 
       mapping = aes(x = year,
                     y = total_cases,
                     {fill} = {country})) +
  geom_point({[color][col][colour]} = {["black"]["#000000"]})
```

Here are two plots showing the change in population over time for each country:

```{r echo=F}
plot3 <- ggplot(hiv_prevalence, 
       aes(year, population, color = country)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Plot A")

plot4 <- ggplot(hiv_prevalence, 
       aes(year, population)) + 
  geom_point(color = point_color) +
  ggtitle("Plot B")

plot3 + plot4
```

**Complete the code below to create Plot B**

Note: The R color used to color points in Plot B is called "`r point_color`".

```{r eval = F}
ggplot(data = hiv_prevalence, 
             mapping = aes(x = year, 
                           {[y = population][population]|2})) {+} 
      {geom_line({[color = point_color][colour = point_color][col = point_color]|2})}
```
