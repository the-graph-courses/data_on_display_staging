# Q 9:

All EXCEPT ONE of the code chunks shown will plot the scatter plot seen, using the `women` dataset in R.

Which code chunk is faulty?

(Hint: `women` is a built-in R dataset, so you can test these on your computer)

```{r echo = F}
ggplot(women) + 
  geom_point(aes(height, weight))
```

## A

```{r eval = F}
ggplot(data = women, 
       mapping = aes(x = height, 
                     y = weight)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## B

```{r eval = F}
ggplot(women, aes(height, weight)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## C

```{r eval = F}
women %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = height, 
                       y = weight)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## D

```{r eval = F}
women %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = height, y = weight)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## E

```{r eval = F}
ggplot(dataset = women, 
       aesthet = c(height, weight)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## Answer

E

## Correct message

Great catch!

`dataset` and `aesthet` are incorrect arguments of `ggplot()`.

As you can see, there are many ways to write correct ggplot code.

In this example, the most explicit code would be:

```{r eval = F}
ggplot(data = women, 
       mapping = aes(x = height, y = weight)) + 
  geom_point()
```

But we can skip the argument names as long as we provide the data and the aesthetic mappings as the first and second arguments (because R matches arguments by position):

```{r eval = F}
ggplot(women, aes(x = height, y = weight)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Similarly, `x` and `y` are the first and second arguments in the `aes()` function, so if we provide the argument values in the right order, we can skip `x =` and `y =` in the code

# Q 11:

The scatterplot below uses the `storms` dataset from {dplyr} to visualize the positions and movements of hurricanes in the Unites States in the year 2005.

```{r}
hurricanes <- storms  %>% filter(status == "hurricane", year == 2005)

ggplot(data = hurricanes, 
       mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, color = name)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Which of the options below correctly describes the aesthetic mappings of this plot?

## A

-   The latitude variable is mapped to the x aesthetic
-   The longitude variable is mapped to y aesthetic
-   The name variable is mapped to the color aesthetic

## B

-   The latitude aesthetic is mapped to the x axis
-   The longitude aesthetic is mapped to y axis
-   The name aesthetic is mapped to the point color

## Answer

A

## Correct message

Looks like you got it!

The aesthetics used in this plot are x, y and color. Each of these aesthetics is mapped to variable from the data.

Remember that the word "map" used here does not refer to a geographic map! When we say something like "the name variable is mapped to the color aesthetic" we mean "the name variable is *represented by* or *linked to* the color aesthetic".

# Q 12:

In which layer would you define the color of your geometric object as an aesthetic mapping?

## A

the `aes` layer

## B

the `geom` layer

## C

the `statistics` layer

## D

the `data` layer

## Answer

A

## Correct message

Exactly right!

It's defined with the `aes`thetic layer.

For example:

```{r}
ggplot(iris, 
       aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Petal.Width, color = Species)) + ## aesthetic layer
  geom_point()
```

## Incorrect message

Sorry, that's not it!

It's defined with the `aes`thetic layer. For example:

```{r}
ggplot(iris, 
       aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Petal.Width, color = Species)) + ## aesthetic layer
  geom_point()
```

# Q 18:

The first layer in `ggplot()` is the data layer. Select the code block below that properly defines this layer from the options below.

## A

```{r eval = F}
ggplot(data=dengue)
```

## B

```{r eval = F}
ggplot() + data(dengue)
```

## C

```{r eval = F}
ggplot.data(dengue)
```

## Answer

A

## Correct message

That's the one!

Remember that you can type in `?ggplot` into your R console to see how to properly define the arguments for this function.

## Incorrect message

Remember that you can type in `?ggplot` into your R console to see how to properly define the arguments for this function.

# Q 19:

The code below tries to use the `swiss` dataset (a built-in R dataset) to create a scatter plot of `Infant.Mortality` against `Fertility`, but generates a blank plot due to an error/oversight.

```{r eval = F}
ggplot(data = swiss, 
       mapping = aes(x = Fertility, 
                     y = Infant.Mortality))
```

What is the problem with the code above?

## A

It is missing a data layer

## B

It is missing an aesthetic mapping

## C

It is missing a geometric function

## Answer

C

## Correct message

Nice work! The data layer and aesthetic mappings are properly specified, but there is no `geom_*` function. In this case, `geom_point()` is needed:

```{r}
ggplot(data = swiss, 
       mapping = aes(x = Fertility, 
                     y = Infant.Mortality)) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = swiss, 
       mapping = aes(x = Fertility, 
                     y = Infant.Mortality)) + 
  geom_point()
```

# Q 20:

The code below attempts to create a scatterplot of weight against height using the `women` dataset (a built-in R dataset).

The code is faulty however, and generates no plot.

```{r eval = F}
ggplot(women, aes(x = height, y = weight)) %>% 
  geom_point()
```

Which of the options below accurately describes the issue with the code?

## A

The code is missing the x and y aesthetic mappings.

## B

The code uses `%>%` instead of `+` to link the layers of the ggplot.

## C

The code is missing the `data` argument to ggplot.

## Answer

B

## Correct message

Great work!

Indeed the code uses uses `%>%` instead of `+`. This is a common error when plotting with ggplot. Luckily, ggplot2 now gives you a helpful warning when you make this mistake.

As for the other two options, remember that in R, function arguments can be matched by position, without explicitly naming the arguments.

So, the abbreviated

```{r eval = F}
ggplot(women, aes(x = height, y = weight))
```

and the longer

```{r eval = F}
ggplot(data = women, mapping = aes(x = height, y = weight))
```

are functionally equivalent.

# Q 21:

You try to plot a graph with the following code:

```{r eval = F}
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = height, y = weight)) +
  geom_point()
```

but R returns an error message. What is the problem with this code?

## A

No color has been defined for the plot, so all the data points are transparent.

## B

No geometric layer has been defined yet.

## C

No dataset has been provided yet.

## Answer

C

## Correct message

**G**ood **g**ame! The data for ggplot to use has not been specified.

Here is the correct call, and the resulting output:

```{r}
ggplot(data = women, 
       mapping = aes(x = height, y = weight)) + 
  geom_point()
```

# Q fixing aesthetics

Consider the plot shown below, which shows the populations of North and South Korea from 1995 to 2013:

```{r}
koreas_pop <-
  tidyr::population %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("Republic of Korea", 
                        "Democratic People's Republic of Korea"))

ggplot(data = koreas_pop,
       mapping = aes(x = year, y = population, color = country)) + 
  geom_line()
```

How could we change the code to generate a plot with thicker lines?

**Important note**: the latest version of {ggplot2} has added an aesthetic called `linewidth` that will replace `size` aesthetic for scaling the width of lines in line based geoms like `geom_line()`. Unfortunately, Our lesson was written and recorded before release of {ggplot2} 3.6.0 on 04/11/2022. The `size` will still work, but it is recommended to update all code to reflect the new aesthetic. We have updated the quizzes and lesson code, however the lesson video has not been updated yet. Apologies for any inconvenience.
If you not updated {ggplot2} since then 04/11/2022, please reinstall the latest version by restarting you R session and then running `install.packages("ggplot2")` in R. You can find out which version you have installed by running `packageVersion("ggplot2")` or by looking at the "Packages" tab in RStudio.

## A

Add `linewidth = 3` inside the `aes()` function.

## B

Add `linewidth = 3` inside the `geom_line()` function.

## C

Add `linewidth = 3` inside the `ggplot()` function, but outside the `aes()` function.

## Answer

B

## Correct message

Great work! This is an example of *fixing* an aesthetic (in this case, we want to fix the `linewidth` aesthetic of the lines to  `3`).

Fixing an aesthetic should be done within the `geom_*` function.

Here is the modified plot:

```{r}
ggplot(data = koreas_pop,
       mapping = aes(x = year, y = population, color = country)) + 
  geom_line(linewidth = 3)
```

Remember that you can work with this dataset on your own computer; the `population` dataset is loaded with the {tidyverse} packages.

# Q 22:

Which of the following is NOT a valid geom function in {ggplot2}?

## A

`geom_col()`

## B

`geom_line()`

## C

`geom_point()`

## D

`geom_shade()`

## Answer

D

## Correct message

That's the one!

All others are valid (and very common) geoms.

Here is a plot with all three geoms, using the `population` dataset from {tidyr}:

```{r}
china_pop <- tidyr::population %>% filter(country == "China")

ggplot(data = china_pop, 
       mapping = aes(x = year, y = population)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  geom_point(size = 4) + 
  geom_line(linewidth = 2)
```

Of course, this is a *redundant* plot. We don't need three layers just to show one series of values. Only one of these geoms would be sufficient.

## A

`geom_scatterplot()`

## B

`geom_point()`

## C

`geom_line()`

## Answer

A

## Correct message

Great going!

`geom_scatterplot()` is not a ggplot2 function. Scatter plots are typically created with `geom_point()` in R. For example, here is a scatter plot of petal length and width in the `iris` dataset, made with `geom_point()`:

```{r}
ggplot(iris, 
       aes(x = Petal.Length, 
           y = Petal.Width, 
           color = Species)) +

# Q 26:

The following code chunk generates a scatterplot of age and the daily number of TV hours watched, from a survey in the US:

```{r}
survey_sample <- forcats::gss_cat %>% slice_sample(n = 200) # sample 200 respondents
head(survey_sample)

ggplot(survey_sample, 
       aes(x = age, y = tvhours)) +

Which of the following would apply an aesthetic mapping to differentiate by the `marital` variable?

## A

```{r eval = F}
ggplot(survey_sample,
       aes(x = age, y = tvhours)) + 
  geom_point(color = marital)

## Answer

C

## Correct message

You got it!

`color = marital` inside the `aes` mapping will produce different colors for each marital status. The other three code chunks don't work.

Here is the final plot:

```{r}
ggplot(survey_sample,
       aes(x = age, y = tvhours, color = marital)) + 
  geom_point()

Take a look at the first 6 rows of this dataset, which records the total number of HIV cases per year in Ghana, Thailand, and Zambia from 1995 to 2009.

```{r}
head(hiv_prevalence)

We plotted the following line graph showing `total_cases` per `year` using `geom_line()`:

```{r echo = F}
ggplot(hiv_prevalence, aes(year, total_cases, color = country)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1)

All EXCEPT ONE of the following statements is true about the `ggplot` code needed to create this plot.

Which statement is FALSE?

## A

The `x` aesthetic argument should go inside `aes()`.

## B

The `y` aesthetic argument should go inside `aes()`.

## C

The `color` aesthetic argument should go outside `aes()`.

## D

The `color` aesthetic argument should go inside `aes()`.

## Answer

C

## Correct message

Great job!

You can tell that color is an aesthetic **mapping** and not a **fixed** aesthetic because the lines in this plot are different for each country. Since the color of geoms is informed by a data variable, it must go in `mapping = aes()`.

Here is the code used to create this plot:

```{r eval = F}
ggplot(hiv_prevalence, 
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = total_cases, 
                     color = country)) +
  geom_line()
```

**`ggplot()`** is **`mapping`** three data variables inside **`aes()`**:

-   `year` is mapped to the `x` position aesthetic

-   `total_cases` is mapped to the `y` position aesthetic

-   `country` is mapped to the `color` aesthetic.

If we want to set `color` to a constant value like `"red"` , it should outside `aes()` as a fixed aesthetic.
