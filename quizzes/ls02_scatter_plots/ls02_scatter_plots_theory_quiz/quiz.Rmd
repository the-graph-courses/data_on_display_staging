# Q - fixed aes cars 1

The scatter plot below uses the `mtcars` dataset to visualize automobile weight (`wt`) vs. gross horsepower (`hp`).

```{r}
# You can run this code on your own computer, mtcars is a built-in R dataset.
head(mtcars)

ggplot(data = mtcars,
       mapping = aes(x = wt, 
                     y = hp)) +
  geom_point()
```

A number of additional aesthetics can be specified in `geom_point()`, such as `color`, `size`, `shape`, and `alpha`.

Which of the following is a valid input for modifying aesthetics in `geom_point()`

## A

`geom_point(size = 3)`

## B

`geom_point(alpha = 2)`

## C

`geom_point(color = blue)`

## D

`geom_point(shape = point)`

## Answer

A

## Correct message

Perfect!

Aesthetics set inside directly inside a `geom_*()` function are fixed aesthetics.

-   `size` `size` should be set to a number (measured in millimeters), so `size = 3` is a valid input which will increase point size to 3mm.
-   `color` needs to be a character string (e.g., `"blue"`), so `color = blue` will cause an error.
-   `shape` names can be set to certain integers or character strings. There is no shape called `point`.
-   `alpha` ranges from 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (completely opaque). Setting `alpha = 2` does not increase the opacity of points.

See [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html#point) to learn more fixed aesthetics for points in {ggplot2}.

Remember that you can try different options on your own without installing external packages; the `mtcars` dataset is built in to R.

## Correct message

You're miles ahead!

Aesthetics set inside directly inside a `geom_*()` function are fixed aesthetics and should be set to a constant value.

-   `size` is set to a numeric value, units are millimeters, so `size = 3` is a valid input.
-   `color` needs to be a character string (e.g., `"blue"`), so `color = blue` will cause an error.
-   `shape` names can be set to certain integers or character strings. There is no shape called `point`.
-   `alpha` ranges from 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (completely opaque). Setting `alpha = 0.8` will decrease the opacity of points.

# Q - overplotting diamonds 1

With large datasets, the points in a scatter plot may overlap and prevent the viewer from accurately assessing the distribution of the data.

For example, you can use the `diamonds` from {ggplo2} to visualize relationship between the weight of a diamond and it's price in US dollars:

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, 
       mapping = aes(x = carat, 
                     y = price)) +
  geom_point()
```

This scatter plot contains about 54,000 points! They are heavily overplotted, making it impossible to get a sense of the relative density of points in different areas of the graph.

What can you add to this code to help you visualize overlapping points?

## A

We can make the points semitransparent using the `alpha` aesthetic, by setting `alpha = 0.1` in `geom_point()`

## B

We can make the points semitransparent using the `alpha` aesthetic, by setting `alpha = 1.9` in `geom_point()`

## C

We can make the points semitransparent using the `alpha` aesthetic, by setting `alpha = 0.1` in `aes()`

## D

We can make the points semitransparent by avoiding darker shades and using lighter color, by setting `color = "lightgray"` for example.

## Answer

A

## Correct message

Wow, you could see through the wrong answers!

Adding a degree of transparency with `alpha` as a fixed aesthetic in `geom_point()` can help visualize overlapping points. `alpha = 0.1` makes them 90% transparent.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, 
       mapping = aes(x = carat, 
                     y = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1)
```

When used as a fixed aesthetic - like we are doing here - `alpha` takes a numeric value that can range from 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (completely opaque). Setting `alpha = 1.9` does not increase the transparency, and is not helpful for overplotting.

Setting point `color` to a lighter color doesn't change the level of opacity/transparency. The points will still be completely opaque (unless we also decrease `alpha`), so this does not help us visualize relative density.

Bonus: Fitting a smooth curve through points in a scatter plot with `geom_smooth()` can also help us increase *clarity* in the presence of overplotting.

```

Which of the following will aid viewers to increase *clarity* in a scatter plot when there is overplotting?

## A

Setting `alpha = 2` in `aes()`

## B

Setting `alpha = 2` in `geom_point()`

## C

Setting `alpha = 0.1` in `aes()`

## D

None of these options will improve the readability of overplotted points.

## Answer

D

## Correct message

You *clear*ly know what you're doing!

Fixed aesthetics should not be set in `aes()`. Instead, adding a degree of transparency with `alpha` as a fixed aesthetic in `geom_point()` can help visualize overlapping points.

For example, `alpha = 0.1` makes them 90% transparent.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, 
       mapping = aes(x = carat, 
                     y = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1)
```

When used as a fixed aesthetic `alpha` takes a numeric value that can range from 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (completely opaque). Setting `alpha = 2` does not increase the transparency, and is not helpful for overplotting.

Bonus: Fitting a smooth curve through points in a scatter plot with `geom_smooth()` can also help us see patterns in the presence of overplotting.

# Q - overplotting diamonds 3

With large datasets, the points in a scatter plot may overlap and prevent the viewer from accurately assessing the distribution of the data.

For example, you can use the `diamonds` from {ggplo2} to visualize relationship between the weight of a diamond and it's price in US dollars:

```{r}

       mapping = aes(x = carat, 
                     y = price)) +
  geom_point()
```

This scatter plot contains about 54,000 points! They are heavily overplotted, making it impossible to get a sense of the relative density of points in different areas of the graph.

Which of the following will help us understand relationships in a scatter plot when there are a lot of overlapping points?

## A

Adding an additional geometric layer with `geom_smooth()`

## B

Setting `alpha = 0.05` in `geom_point()`

## C

Setting `alpha = 0.2` in `geom_point()`

## D

All of these options will aid in highlighting patterns in scatter plot when there is overplotting.

## Answer

D

## Correct message

Great job connecting the dots!

Adding a degree of transparency with `alpha` as a fixed aesthetic in `geom_point()` can help visualize overlapping points.

For example, `alpha = 0.05` makes them 95% transparent.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, 
       mapping = aes(x = carat, 
                     y = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.05)
```

Fitting a smooth curve through points in a scatter plot with `geom_smooth()` can also help us increase *clarity* in the presence of overplotting.

## Incorrect message

There are few different approaches to addressing overplotting on a scatterplot:

1)  Adding a degree of transparency with `alpha` as a fixed aesthetic in `geom_point()` can help visualize overlapping points.

For example, `alpha = 0.05` makes them 95% transparent.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, 
       mapping = aes(x = carat, 
                     y = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.05)
```

2)  Fitting a smooth curve through points in a scatter plot with `geom_smooth()` can also help us increase *clarity* in the presence of overplotting.

The `midwest` dataset from {ggplot2} contains demographic information from the a 2000 US census. We can use a scatter plot to look at the correlation between the percentage of people with high school diploma and the percentage of people with a college (university) education:

```{r}
# You can run this code on your computer; the midwest dataset is loaded with {ggplot2}
ggplot(data = midwest, 
       mapping = aes(x = perchsd, 
                     y = percollege)) +
  geom_point()
```

Adding a fitted line to a scatter plot can help us highlight trends in the data. We can do this by adding a second geometry layer with the `geom_smooth()` function.

In `ggplot2` graphs, we chain together multiple geometry layers using the `+` sign, like so:

```{r warning = F}
ggplot(data = midwest, 
       mapping = aes(x = perchsd, 
                     y = percollege)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

Which of the following statements is TRUE?

*Hint*: copy the code above and experiment with different ways of combining layers, and closely examine the results.

## A

{ggplot2} will automatically layer the trend line on top of the points, so the order in which you chain `geom_*()` functions does not matter.

## B

{ggplot2} will display layers in the order they appear in your code.

## 

Adding `geom_smooth()` before `geom_point()` will result in and error. You need to plot the points first so that line has something to be fitted to.

## Answer

B

## Correct message

You're trendy!

Geometry layers are plotted in the order they appear in the code, one on top of the other. Adding `geom_point()` before `geom_smooth()` will plot the points first, and then draw the smoothing line on top of it (see above).

The opposite is also true:

```{r warning = F}
ggplot(data = midwest, 
       mapping = aes(x = perchsd, 
                     y = percollege)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  geom_point()
```

Adding `geom_smooth()` before `geom_point()` means that the points layer is plotted on top of the smoothing layer. You can increase point size on this plot to see this better.

## Incorrect message

The order of layers is not pointless!

  geom_smooth() +
  geom_point()
```

Adding `geom_smooth()` before `geom_point()` means that the points layer is plotted on top of the smoothing layer. You can increase point size on this plot to see this better.

Generally, this is not something you want to do, but it's important to understand how the layers are ordered.

# Q - understand smoothing usage

Which of the following is NOT true about smoothing with `geom_smooth()`?

## A

Adding a smoothing layer can aid the eye in seeing overall patterns on a scatterplot.

## B

You can specify which smoothing function to use by adding the `method` argument.

## C

The smoothing function is fitted applied to the data variables specified in `aes()`.

## D

A smoothing curve is drawn to fit the points on a scatter plot created by `geom_point()`. No points will result in no smoothing line being plotted.

## Answer

D

## Correct message

You've got the point!

The smoothing method (or function) used by `geom_smooth()` is fitted to the data, not the points on a different layer.

When we add `geom_smooth()` to `geom_point()`, both layers inherit the `x` and `y` aesthetic mappings from `aes()`:

```{r}
# Percent of elderly below poverty line vs percent college educated
ggplot(data = midwest, 
       mapping = aes(x = percollege,
                     y = percelderlypoverty)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

Aesthetic inheritance ensures that you're not mapping completely different variables to each geometry layer. So functionally it looks like the line is fitted to the points on the scatterplot.

However, you can use just `geom_smooth()` without `geom_point()` and it will still plot a function to show relationship between the data variables provided:

```{r}
ggplot(data = midwest, 
       mapping = aes(x = percollege,
                     y = percelderlypoverty)) +
  geom_smooth()
```

The `method` argument specifies which smoothing function should be used to fit the data. If you don't specify a particular method, the default for two continuous variables is generally `"loess"` smooth, but you can use other modelling functions such as like `"lm"` for linear regression.

```{r}
ggplot(data = midwest, 
       mapping = aes(x = percollege,
                     y = percelderlypoverty)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

# Q - confidence intervals 1

Nice! We're *confident* that you'll rock this quiz!

The `se` argument in `geom_smooth()` dictates whether or not to display confidence intervals. By default, `se = TRUE`. You can remove these by setting `se = FALSE` or `se = F`.
