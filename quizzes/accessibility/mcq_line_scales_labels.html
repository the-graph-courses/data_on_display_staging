    <h1>Multiple-choice Quiz | Lines, Scales, and Labels</h1>
    <p>This quiz tests your understanding of the lesson on lines, scales, and labels.</p>
    <p>You will be presented with multiple-choice questions where only <strong>1 answer</strong> is correct. Once you have answered all the questions, click on the `CHECK ANSWERS` button. Afterwards, your final score will be shown at the bottom of the page followed by a review of the questions and feedback messages indicating if the question is "Correct" or "Incorrect".</p>
    <p>You can retake this quiz as many times as you'd like; simply refresh the page. Each attempt will present 8 random questions. There are a total of 13 questions in the question bank. We encourage you to retake this quiz multiple times to get additional practice.</p>
    <p>You are now ready to start. Good luck!</p>
