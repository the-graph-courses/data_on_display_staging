    <h1>Multiple-choice Quiz | Intro to ggplot2</h1>
    <p>This quiz tests your understanding of the basic functioning of the {ggplot2} package. </p>
    <p>You will be presented with multiple-choice questions where only <strong>1 answer</strong> is correct. Once you have answered all the questions, click on the `CHECK ANSWERS` button. Afterwards, your final score will be shown at the bottom of the page followed by a review of the questions and feedback messages indicating if the question is "Correct" or "Incorrect".</p>
    <p>You can retake this quiz as many times as you'd like; simply refresh the page. Each attempt will present 9 random questions. There are a total of 17 questions in the question bank. We encourage you to retake this quiz multiple times to get additional practice.</p>
    <p>Note: the latest version of {ggplot2} has added an aesthetic called `linewidth` that will replace `size` aesthetic for scaling the width of lines in line based geoms like `geom_line()`. The `size` aesthetic will still work, but it is recommended to update all code to reflect the new aesthetic.<br>
Unfortunately, our lesson was written and recorded before release of the update.  We have updated this quiz and lesson notes, however the lesson video has not been edited yet. Apologies for any inconvenience.</p>
    <p>You are now ready to start. Good luck!</p>
