```{r, eval = F, include = F}
Hi GRAPH Courses student! 
  
This is a CODE ALONG document where you can type code as you follow the lesson video. 

We encourage you to do this; typing code with the teacher is the best way to learn the right syntax. 

For better clarity, we reccomend viewing this document in VISUAL MODE.
```

```{r setup, include = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Load packages 
if(!require(pacman)) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, knitr, here, patchwork)

# Source functions 
source(here("global/functions/lesson_functions.R"))

# Source autograder script quietly 
source(here("lessons/ls04_histograms_autograder.R"))
```

# Histograms with {ggplot2}

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1.  Plot a histogram to visualize the distribution of continuous variables using **`geom_histogram()`**.
2.  Adjust the number or size of bins on a histogram by with the **`bins`** or **`binwidth`** arguments.
3.  Shift and align bins on a histogram with the **`boundary`** argument.
4.  Set bin boundaries to a sequence of values with the **`breaks`** argument.

## Packages

```{r}
pacman::p_load()
```

## Childhood diarrheal diseases dataset

We will use the **`malidd`** dataset for plotting.

```{r message = F}
# Import data from CSV

```

::: recap
**Recap**

This dataset is from a 2020 research study of diarrhea in children aged 0-59 months.
:::

```{r}
# View first few rows of the data frame
head()
```

## Basic histograms with `geom_histogram()`

Now let's use {ggplot2} to plot the distribution of the **`height_cm`** variable.

The `geom_*()` function used for histograms is **`geom_histogram()`**

```{r}
# Simple histogram showing the distribution of height_cm

```

Let's outline the bars:

```{r}
# Set color to "white"
ggplot(data =  malidd , 
       mapping = aes(x = height_cm)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

We can also add `fill` color:

```{r}
# Set fill color to "steelblue"
ggplot(data =  malidd , 
       mapping = aes(x = height_cm)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white")
```

::: practice
**Practice Questions**

Plot a histogram showing the distribution of age (**`age_months`**) in `malidd`. Make the outline and fill color of the bars "seagreen", and reduce opacity to 40%.

```{r}
# Write code to create your plot
ggplot(data = malidd)
```

```{r}
# When you think you have the right plot, submit your answer by replacing "YOUR ANSWER HERE" with your code, and run those lines.

q1 <- ggplot(data = malidd)

# Make sure that "q1" appears in your Environment tab.
```

```{r}
# Check your answer by running the check function (no inputs required). 

.CHECK_q1()
```

```{r}
# You can ask for a hint by running this hint function (no inputs required).

.HINT_q1()
```

```{r}
# Get the full solution by typing out the solution function:
.SOLUTION_q1()
```

Building on your code for the previous plot, modify the axis titles to "Age (months)" and "Number of children", respectively.

```{r}
# Change axis titles 

```

```{r}
# Submit your answer:
q2 <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"

# Ask for a hint:
.HINT_q2()

# Check your answer:
.CHECK_q2()

```
:::

## Adjusting bins in a histogram

If we don't adjust the bins in `geom_histogram()`, we get a warning message.

```{r}
# Warning message tells us to change the default of 30 bins
ggplot(data =  malidd , 
       mapping = aes(x = height_cm)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", 
                 fill = "steelblue")
```

We can modify bins using one of these three arguments:

1.  Set the number of bins with **`bins`**

2.  Set the width of the bins with **`binwidth`**

3.  Set bin boundaries **`breaks`**

These are fixed aesthetics, so they go inside `geom_histogram()`.

### Modify the number of bins with `bins`

Set `bins` equal to an **integer** in `geom_histogram()`:

```{r}
# Try different numbers of bins
ggplot(data =  malidd , 
       mapping = aes(x = height_cm)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", 
                 fill = "steelblue")
```

::: practice
**Practice Question**

Make a histogram of frequency of respiration (`freqrespi`), which is measured in breaths per minute. Set the interior color to "indianred3", and border color to "lightgray".

```{r}
# Create base histogram

```

Notice that with the default of 30 bins, there are some intervals for which no bar is plotted (i.e., there were no observations in that range).

Low the number of bins until there are no empty intervals. You should choose the highest value of bins for which there are no empty spaces.

```{r}
# Modify the number of bins

```

```{r}
# Submit your answer:
q3 <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"

# Ask for a hint:
.HINT_q3()

# Check your answer:
.CHECK_q3()
```
:::

### Modify the width of bins with `binwidth`

Set `binwidth` equal to a **numeric value** in `geom_histogram()`:

```{r}
# Try different bin widths
ggplot(data =  malidd, 
       mapping = aes(x = height_cm)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", 
                 fill = "steelblue")

```

Looking at the range of the variable can help us choose an appropriate bin width.

```{r}
range()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data =  malidd, 
       mapping = aes(x = height_cm)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", 
                 fill = "steelblue")
```

We can use the **`boundary`** argument to align the bins to the x-axis intervals.

```{r}
# Set `boundary` equal to the low end of
ggplot(data =  malidd, 
       mapping = aes(x = height_cm)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", 
                 fill = "steelblue", 
                 binwidth = 5)
```

::: practice
**Practice Question**

Create the same `freqrespi` histogram from the last practice question, but this time set the bin width to to a value that results in 18 bins. Then align the bars to the x axis breaks by adjusting the bin boundaries.

```{r}
# Create your plot:

```

```{r}
# Submit your answer:
q4 <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"

# Ask for a hint:
.HINT_q4()

# Check your answer:
.CHECK_q4()
```
:::

### Modify bin boundaries with `breaks`

Set `breaks` equal to a **numeric vector** in `geom_histogram()`:

```{r}
# Supply a vector that covers the range of values in height_cm
ggplot(data =  malidd, 
       mapping = aes(x = height_cm)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", 
                 fill = "steelblue")
```

::: practice
**Practice Question**

Plot the `freqrespi` histogram with bin breaks that range from the lowest value of `freqrespi` to the highest, with intervals of 4.

```{r}
# Set bin boundaries

```

Next, adjust the x-axis scale breaks by adding a **`scale_*()`** function. Set the range to 24-60, with an intervals of 8.

```{r}
# Change scale breaks

```

```{r}
# Submit your answer:
q5 <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"

# Ask for a hint:
.HINT_q5()

# Check your answer:
.CHECK_q5()
```
