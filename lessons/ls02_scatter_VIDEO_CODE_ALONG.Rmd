# Childhood diarrheal diseases in Mali

• Data from a prospective observational study of acute diarrhea in children

• The study was conducted in Mali and Bangladesh 

![](images/child_dia_study.jpg)

::: vocab
A prospective study watches for outcomes, such as the development of a disease, during the study period and relates this to other factors such as suspected risk or protection factors.
:::

• Load the **`malidd` data frame** we will use for plotting:

```{r message = FALSE}
# Import preprocessed data to RStudio Environment
malidd <- read_csv(here("data/clean/malidd.csv"))
malidd
```

We will explore relationships between some numerical variables in the **`malidd`** data frame using scatter plots.

# Scatter plots via `geom_point()`

Let's begin by visualizing the relationship between:

1.  `age_months`: **age** on the **x**-axis
2.  `viral_load`: **viral load** on the **y**-axis

```{r}
# Simple scatter plot of viral load vs age

```

• Viral load generally **decreases** with age.

Time to practice plotting!

::: practice
**Using the `malidd` data frame, create a scatter plot showing the relationship between age and height (`height_cm`).

```{r}
# Write code to create your plot:
ggplot()
```

```{r}
# When you think you have the right answer, submit it by replacing "YOUR ANSWER HERE" with your code, and run those lines.

age_height <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"

# Make sure that "age_height" appears in your Environment tab.
```

```{r}
# Check your answer by running this check function (no inputs required). The output will tell you if you answered correctly or not.

.CHECK_age_height()
```

```{r}
# You can ask for a hint by running this hint function (no inputs required).

.HINT_age_height()
```

```{r}
# Get the full solution by typing out the solution function:
.SOLUTION_age_height()
```
:::

# Modifying the aesthetics of points

::: reminder
There are two methods for changing the aesthetic properties of your `geom`s (in this case, points):

1.  You can convey information about your data by *mapping* the variables in your dataset to aesthetics in your plot inside the `aes()` function in the `mapping` argument

2.  You can also set the aesthetic properties of your `geom`s to a *fixed* value, as a direct argument of your `geom_*()` function; i.e. it goes *outside* of `aes()`.
:::

## Mapping data to aesthetics

• First we map will variables to an aesthetic inside `aes()`

• This allows us to visualize a third variable on the scatter plot

Let's map `height_cm` to the colors of our points:

```{r}
ggplot(data = malidd, 
       mapping = aes(x = age_months, 
                     y = viral_load)) + 
  geom_point()
```

• {ggplot2} has automatically **scales** the aesthetic to match values in the variable


• Points are colored by different shades of the blue with darker colors representing lower values

• Height **increases** with age

Let's map a binary variable - `breastfeeding` - to color:

```{r}
ggplot(data = malidd, 
       mapping = aes(x = age_months, 
                     y = viral_load)) + 
  geom_point()
```

• Gradual, continuous color scaling

• The gradient communicates continuum of values

• But `breastfeeding` has only two distinct values: 0 or 1

The `breastfeeding` variable in `malidd` is not a factor:

```{r}
class(malidd$breastfeeding)
```

• Continuous color scaling is not suitable

Add the `factor()` function around a variable to tell `ggplot()` to treat it as a factor:

```{r}
ggplot(data = malidd, 
       mapping = aes(x = age_months, 
                     y = viral_load)) + 
  geom_point()
```

• {ggplot2} assigns a unique level of aesthetic to each unique value of a factor

• Children stopped breastfeeding at around 20 months of age

Adding colors let us visualize a **third variable**

::: practice
• Using the `malidd` data frame, create a scatter plot showing the relationship between age and viral load, and map a third variable, frequency of respiration (`freqrespi`) to color:

```{r}
# Write code to create your plot:

```

```{r}
# Submit your answer:
age_height_respi <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"

# Ask for a hint:
.HINT_age_height_respi()

# Check your answer:
.CHECK_age_height_respi()
```

• Create the same age vs. height scatterplot again, but this time, map the binary variable `fever` to the color of the points. Keep in mind that `fever` should be treated as a factor.

```{r}
# Write code to create your plot:

```

```{r}
# Submit your answer:
age_height_fever <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"

# Ask for a hint:
.HINT_age_height_fever()

# Check your answer:
.CHECK_age_height_fever()
```
:::

## Setting fixed aesthetics

• Aesthetic arguments set to a fixed value will not change with the data

• Fixed aesthetics should be a direct argument in the `geom_*()` function; i.e., it goes *outside* of `mapping = aes()`.

In this section we will change the following aesthetic arguments to fixed values in `geom_point()`:


• `color` - point color or point outline color

• `size` - point size

• `alpha` - point opacity

• `shape` - point shape

• `fill` - point fill color (only applies if the point has an outline)

### Changing `color`, `size` and `alpha`

• Set the color of the points to a fixed value by setting the `color` argument directly within `geom_point()`.

Change point color to steel blue:

```{r}
#  Modify original scatter plot by setting `color = "steelblue"`
ggplot(data = malidd, 
       mapping = aes(x = age_months, 
                     y = viral_load)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Now we will modify the `size` aesthetic of the points by assigning it to a fixed number.

The default size is 1 mm, so let's chose a larger value:

```{r}
#  Set size to 2 mm by ading `size = 2`
ggplot(data = malidd, 
       mapping = aes(x = age_months, 
                     y = viral_load)) + 
  geom_point(color = "steelblue")
```

• The `alpha` aesthetic controls the level of opacity of `geom`s.

•`alpha` ranges from 0 (completely transparent) to the 1 (completely opaque).

Let's make our points more transparent by reducing the opacity:

```{r}
#  Set opacity to 75% by adding `alpha = 0.75`
ggplot(data = malidd, 
       mapping = aes(x = age_months, 
                     y = viral_load)) + 
  geom_point(color = "steelblue",
             size = 2)
```



• We can see with points overlap 

• `alpha` is a useful aesthetic modification when there is **overplotting**



::: practice
• Create a scatter plot with the same variables as the previous example, but change the color of the points to `cornflowerblue`, increase the size of points to 3 mm and set the opacity to 60%.

```{r}
# Write code to create your plot:

```

```{r}
# Submit your answer:
age_viral_blue <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"

# Ask for a hint:
.HINT_age_viral_blue()

# Check your answer:
.CHECK_age_viral_blue()
```
:::

```{r}
age_viral_blue
```

:::


### Changing `shape` and `fill`

• We can shape of points by setting `shape` aesthetic to a number corresponding to our desired shape

• {ggplot2} will accept the following numbers:

![Numerical coding of different shapes in {ggplot2}](images/ggplot_shapes.png){width="400"}

• Shapes 21-24 have both `color` and `fill` aesthetics

Let's modify our original scatterplot by changing the shapes to a something that can be filled in:

```{r}
# Set shape to fillable circles by adding `shape = 21`

ggplot(data = malidd, 
       mapping = aes(x = age_months, 
                     y = viral_load)) + 
  geom_point()
```

The `color` aesthetic only changes the outline of our points:

```{r}
# Set outline color of the shapes by adding `color = cyan4`

ggplot(data = malidd, 
       mapping = aes(x = age_months, 
                     y = viral_load)) + 
  geom_point(shape = 21)
```

Now let's fill in the points:

```{r}
# Set interior color of the shapes by adding `fill = "seagreen"` 

ggplot(data = malidd, 
       mapping = aes(x = age_months, 
                     y = viral_load)) + 
  geom_point(shape = 21,
             color = "cyan4")
```



::: key-point
It's important to note that `color` and `fill` apply to different elements.
• `color` applies color to solid points, lines, text, and borders of shapes
• `fill` applies color to any filled areas, like the interior of shapes
:::

We can improve the readability by increasing size and reducing opacity with `size` and `alpha`:

```{r}
ggplot(data = malidd, 
       mapping = aes(x = age_months, 
                     y = viral_load)) + 
  geom_point(shape = 21,
             color = "cyan4",
             fill = "seagreen")
```

# Adding a trend line

• It can be hard to view relationships or trends with just points

• We can add a smoothing line to a scatter plot

We will take our scatter plot and apply a smoothing line to with add another geometric layer using `geom_smooth()`:

```{r}
ggplot(data = malidd, 
       mapping = aes(x = age_months, 
                     y = viral_load)) + 
  geom_point()
```

• The smoothing line layer is plotted on top of the points

• The smoothing function here is "loess" which stands for for **l**ocally **w**eighted **s**catter plot **s**moothing

• Other smoothing functions can also be used in `geom_smooth()`

Let's use a generalized linear model by setting the `method` argument to "`glm`":

```{r}
# Change to a linear smoothing function with `method = "glm"`
ggplot(data = malidd, 
       mapping = aes(x = age_months, 
                     y = viral_load)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

• 95% confidence limits for these lines are displayed

You can suppress the confidence bands by including the argument `se = FALSE` inside `geom_smooth()`:

```{r}
# Remove confidence interval bands by adding `se = FALSE`
ggplot(data = malidd, 
       mapping = aes(x = age_months, 
                     y = viral_load)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "glm")
```

We can also add `color` inside `geom_smooth()`:

```{r}
# Change the color of the trend line by adding `color = "darkred"`
ggplot(data = malidd, 
       mapping = aes(x = age_months, 
                     y = viral_load)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "glm",
              se = FALSE)
```

• A *negative relationship* exists between `age_months` and `viral_load`


Now we will add a third variable to this plot.

•`vomit` is a binary variable from the `malidd` dataset

• It records whether or not the patient vomited

We will map it to the color aesthetic:

```{r}
ggplot(data = malidd, 
       mapping = aes(x = age_months, 
                     y = viral_load)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "glm",
              se = FALSE,
              color = "darkred")
```

Let's also change the smoothing method to generalized additive model ("`gam`") and make some aesthetic modifications to the line in the `geom_smooth()` layer:

```{r}
ggplot(data = malidd, 
       mapping = aes(x = age_months, 
                     y = viral_load)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = factor(vomit))) +
  geom_smooth(method = "glm",
              se = FALSE,
              color = "darkred")
```

• The blue points mostly occur above the trend line 
• Children with higher viral loads were more likely to exhibit symptoms of vomiting

::: practice
• Create a scatter plot with the `age_months` and `height_cm` variables. Set the color of the points to "steelblue", the size to 2.5mm, the opacity to 80%. Then add trend line with the smoothing method "lm" (linear model). To make the trend line stand out, set its color to "indianred3".

```{r}
# Write code to create your plot:

```

```{r}
# Submit your answer:
age_height_2 <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"

# Ask for a hint:
.HINT_age_height_2()

# Check your answer:
.CHECK_age_height_2()
```

• Recreate the plot you made in the previous question, but this time adapt the code to change the shape of the points to tilted rectangles (number 23), and add the body temperature variable (`temp`) by **mapping** it to fill color of the points.

```{r}
# Write code to create your plot:

```

```{r}
# Submit your answer:
age_height_3 <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"

# Ask for a hint:
.HINT_age_height_3()

# Check your answer:
.CHECK_age_height_3()
```

# Learning Outcomes

1.  You can visualize relationships between two numerical variables using **scatter plots** with **`geom_point()`**.
2.  You can use **`color`** as an aesthetic argument to map additional variables from the data onto a bivariate scatter plot.
3.  You can assign **fixed aesthetics** such as size, shape, color, fill, and opacity of geometric objects
4.  You can add and modify a **trend line** to a scatter plot with **`geom_smooth()`**.

# Summary

Scatter plots display the relationship between two numerical variables.

With medium to large datasets, you may need to play around with the different modifications to scatter plots we saw such as adding trend lines, changing the color, size, shape, fill, or opacity of the points. This tweaking is often a fun part of data visualization, since you'll have the chance to see different relationships emerge as you tinker with your plots.
